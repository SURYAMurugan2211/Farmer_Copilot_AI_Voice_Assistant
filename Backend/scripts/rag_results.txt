  LLM ANSWER: To detect wheat leaf disease, you can use computer vision algorithms such as YOLO-Wheat or Transformer Models, which can identify diseases like rust and Septoria by analyzing photos of wheat leaves. Take clear photographs of your wheat leaves, especially if you notice orange/brown pustules or yellow spots, and use these algorithms to detect diseases. Alternatively, consult with a pathologist or an agricultural expert for manual inspection and guidance.

  LLM ANSWER: The best fertilizer for rice depends on the soil test results. However, according to the provided context, it is recommended to omit phosphorus application in rice if the preceding wheat crop received the recommended dose of phosphatic fertilizer. For nitrogen, it's advised to use it judiciously based on the Leaf Colour Chart (LCC). Additionally, applying farm yard manure (FYM) can enhance soil health and water-holding capacity.
